Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a PhD student at the University of Glasgow, supervised by Dr. [Jianglin Lan](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z7kvat4AAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on multimodal understanding & generation.
Before this, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at Huawei from Jun. 2022 to Sep. 2024.
I completed my Master's at Southeast University in China, under Prof. [Changyin Sun](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changyin-Sun) and [Teng Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=hpF7i8sAAAAJ).
